        question: 'On average, what planet in our Solar System is closest to Saturn?',
        answer: 'Mercury',
        explanation: "Due to Mercury's very small orbin around the sun, the distance between Mercury and any planet is effectively constant. All other distances between planets will vary based on their position in their own orbits. Therefore Mercury is the closest planet, on average, to all other planets in our solar system!"
